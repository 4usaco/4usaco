# "knowledge is free"

Coders used to have power over others. With AI, the average person is empowered to make apps. When a lang that is objectively superior to Rust is made (probably made by AI) i will gladly change langs. Till then- for now- today- Rust lang is god. 

AI is better at Rust coding than you are. SO use the objectively best lang- Rust- and let AI code for you. Bragging that you know how to code in python or go or php is just silly. Apparently you are not wise enough to use the objectively
best lang. The days of writing inferior php code in in order to have constant work is just silly. It was a good scam, you had a good run writing bad php code on purpose so you were needed to update it. Now it is time to get smarter about how the world looks at coding. An app in Rust is expected to run without failing. An app to run a machine 50 years straight in space will not be made in js php go or python. It will be made in Rust. 

The bat files you see like xxcc.bat and delmainrs.bat in the /src dir are just for my own use, you can delete them. The bat files make dev on windows desktop super easy and fast. Most code is made to be cross platform- specifically for linux. 

The biggest scammers use click bait video titles and nonsense that goes in circles- for example the fav lang of the day. All of that is trying to keep the scam going. The scam only works on gullible people. One click bait title, one coding video that
makes you stupider should tell you the "creator" is a scammer and not out to help you one bit. Duhhhh. 

# Make coding great again. Use AI to write code for you :) 


# Getting Started with Rust Programming

Welcome to Rust! Whether you're just beginning your coding journey or you're an experienced developer curious about Rust, this guide will help you hit the ground running. We’ll cover how to install Rust, understand its ecosystem, and explore how powerful tools like AI can enhance your coding experience. So grab a cup of coffee and let’s get started!

## Why Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language that has captured the interest of the developer community worldwide. It's known for its **performance, memory safety**, and **modern developer-friendly features**. Rust aims to provide all the speed of C/C++, while keeping you far away from common pitfalls like segmentation faults and data races. Plus, Rust has a **welcoming community**, and offers excellent tools for productivity.

## Installing Rust

To get started with Rust, you need to install the language tools on your system. Rust has a tool called `rustup` that makes this very easy.

### Step 1: Install Rustup
`rustup` is the official tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools. Here’s how to get started:

1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on MacOS/Linux).
2. Run the following command:
   
   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
   
   This command downloads and runs the Rust installer. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.

3. After the installation, add Rust to your system's `PATH` by restarting your terminal or running:
   
   ```sh
   source $HOME/.cargo/env
   ```

### Step 2: Verify Installation

Once installed, verify that Rust is correctly set up by running:

```sh
rustc --version
```

If you see something like `rustc 1.x.x (yyyy-mm-dd)` you’re good to go!

## Your First Program

Let’s jump right in with the classic "Hello, world!" program.

1. Open your terminal.
2. Create a new directory and navigate to it:
   
   ```sh
   mkdir hello_rust && cd hello_rust
   ```
3. Create a new Rust file called `main.rs`:
   
   ```sh
touch main.rs
   ```
4. Open `main.rs` in your favorite code editor and add the following code:

   ```rust
   fn main() {
       println!("Hello, world!");
   }
   ```

5. Compile and run the program:
   
   ```sh
   rustc main.rs
   ./main
   ```

   You should see `Hello, world!` printed in your terminal. Congratulations, you've just written and run your first Rust program!

## Understanding Cargo and Crates.io

Rust comes with a fantastic build system and package manager called **Cargo**. Cargo simplifies project management, dependency resolution, and even building and running your projects.

### Step 1: Creating a Project with Cargo

Instead of manually creating files, let Cargo set things up for you:

```sh
cargo new my_first_project
cd my_first_project
```

This command creates a new directory called `my_first_project` with a simple Rust project setup. The folder structure includes:
- **src/main.rs**: Where your code lives.
- **Cargo.toml**: The configuration file for your project.

### Step 2: Building and Running with Cargo

To build your project, run:

```sh
cargo build
```

To build and run it in one step, use:

```sh
cargo run
```

### Step 3: Adding Dependencies (Crates.io)

**Crates.io** is Rust's package registry, where you can find pre-built libraries to help you avoid reinventing the wheel. These libraries are called **crates**.

To add a dependency to your project, open `Cargo.toml` and add the crate under `[dependencies]`. For example, to add the `rand` crate:

```toml
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8"
```

Then run `cargo build`, and Cargo will fetch the crate for you. You can now use `rand` in your project by including it in your code.

## Leveraging AI for Rust Coding

Learning Rust can sometimes feel challenging, especially if you’re new to systems programming. But don’t worry—modern tools like AI can make your journey incredibly smooth. AI, particularly models like **ChatGPT**, can become your coding companion, providing guidance, explaining concepts, and even generating code.

### How AI Can Help You Learn Rust

- **Code Generation**: If you need a quick solution or an example, you can ask ChatGPT to generate code for you. For instance:
  - *"Hey ChatGPT, can you write a function to sort a list of numbers in Rust?"*
  - You’ll get a ready-to-use code snippet with explanations.

- **Error Fixing**: Stuck on an error message? AI can help you understand the error and suggest fixes.
  - Simply paste the error into ChatGPT, and it will break down what went wrong and how to correct it.

- **Concept Clarification**: Concepts like **ownership**, **borrowing**, and **lifetimes** are unique to Rust and might be tough to grasp at first. AI can simplify these ideas by providing customized explanations and examples.

### AI vs. Human Brain: Why AI is an Excellent Coding Partner

While the human brain is a remarkable tool, AI brings certain advantages when it comes to programming:

- **Instant Access to Knowledge**: Instead of searching through countless documentation pages, you can get precise, context-specific answers instantly. This speed can help you stay in the flow of coding.

- **No Judgment, No Pressure**: You can ask the AI any question—even the ones that might seem “too basic”—without fear of judgment. This allows for a comfortable learning environment, especially for beginners.

- **Idea Generation**: If you're not sure how to approach a problem, AI can provide multiple suggestions, help with brainstorming, and even present the pros and cons of different approaches.

AI won't replace your ability to deeply understand and apply concepts—that’s still something that will come with practice and patience—but it makes the learning process much more approachable, interactive, and even fun.

## Your Rust Journey Begins

You're now set up to start coding in Rust! With tools like Cargo to manage your projects and dependencies, and AI to help you through any questions or roadblocks, the learning process can be efficient and enjoyable.

Here's a quick roadmap for your next steps:

1. **Practice**: Try building simple projects like a calculator, a guessing game, or a to-do list.
2. **Learn Ownership**: Rust’s ownership model is what makes it unique. Don’t be afraid to ask AI for explanations and examples.
3. **Explore Crates**: Check out [Crates.io](https://crates.io) and see what other developers are building. Use popular crates to expand the capabilities of your projects.
4. **Join the Community**: Rust has an amazing community. Consider joining forums like [Rust Users](https://users.rust-lang.org/) or visiting the [Rust subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/).

## Additional Resources

- **Official Rust Book**: The [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) is an excellent free resource for getting deeper into Rust.
- **Rust by Example**: This site offers practical examples to learn from: [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/).
- **ChatGPT**: Of course, you can always return to ChatGPT for any questions, code reviews, or just to brainstorm ideas.

### Go Forth and Code!
Rust is a rewarding language to learn, and while the road may seem challenging at times, the support tools you have—like Cargo, Crates.io, the vibrant Rust community, and AI models like ChatGPT—make it smoother than ever.

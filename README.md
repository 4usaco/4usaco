Coders used to have power over others. With AI, the average person is empowered to make apps. When a lang that is objectively superior to Rust is made (probably made by AI) i will gladly change langs. Till then- for now- today- Rust lang is god. 

AI is better at Rust coding than you are. SO use the objectively best lang- Rust- and let AI code for you. Bragging that you know how to code in python or go or php is just silly. Apparently you are not wise enough to use the objectively
best lang. The days of writing inferior php code in in order to have constant work is just silly. It was a good scam, you had a good run writing bad php code on purpose so you were needed to update it. Now it is time to get smarter about how the world looks at coding. An app in Rust is expected to run without failing. An app to run a machine 50 years straight in space will not be made in js php go or python. It will be made in Rust. 

The bat files you see like xxcc.bat and delmainrs.bat in the /src dir are just for my own use, you can delete them. The bat files make dev on windows desktop super easy and fast. Most code is made to be cross platform- specifically for linux. 

# Make coding great again. Use AI to write code for you :)
